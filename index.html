              catty ipsum mesmerizing birds sleep on my human’s head. <span>Hide head
              under blanket</span> so no one can see stares at human while pushing stuff
              off a table. Cat not kitten around claws in your leg kitty kitty but

          <h3>THE KITTIES TO GO STORY</h3>
          <p>Fall asleep on the washing machine snuggles up to shoulders or knees
            and purrs you to sleep. Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws
            clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then <span>retire
            to the warmest spot</span> on the couch to claw at the fabric before
            taking a catnap attempt to leap between furniture but woefully
            miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what’s your problem? I meant
            to do that now i shall wash myself intently cough and swat at dog. </p>
          <p>Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) fooled again thinking
            the dog likes me. Jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare
            fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed hiss at vacuum
            cleaner and always hungry for lie on your belly and purr when you are
            asleep stretch.</p>
