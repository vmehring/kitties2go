        <h3>MEET PEPITA!</h3>
        <p>Look at this stylish cutie! Pepita is a sweet, laid-back three-year-old
          kitty with many unique qualities. In addition to her beautiful coat,
          she has the darkest eyes we've ever seen on a cat! She has unusual
          dietary preferences as well. Her favorite treats are overripe fruit
          and bugs of any kind, but especially crickets. And she never gets
          hairballs!</p>
        <p class="quote">I love to dig through your kitchen compost
          container and potted plants. And your laundry. And any slighly-less-than-
          solid drywall. I just love digging. I dig digging! Haha! Get it?<br>- Pepita</p>
        <p>Pepita's scent is as unique as the rest of her! She smells... not like
          other cats. If you ever find that you are unable to smell Pepita, <span>please
          make sure she hasn't escaped.</span> If she has, please contact Kitties
          to Go immediately. If she hasn't escaped and you still can't
          smell her, please see your doctor.</p>
